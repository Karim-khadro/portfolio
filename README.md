# Portfolio
Customizable portfolio website. Built-in ReactJs and Tailwind CSS. 

## Customization
- The [text.js]( "src/text.js) file contains all the texts, so if you like the theme and the colors, you need to change the text only.
- The [tailwind.config.js]("tailwind.config.js") file contains the main theme color alongside the main font.
- To delete or add sections, an intervention in the [mainPage.js]("src/mainPage.js) is required with some knowledge in ReactJs and Tailwind.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
